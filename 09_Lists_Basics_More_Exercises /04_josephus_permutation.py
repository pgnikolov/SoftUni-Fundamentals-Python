# You are now to create a program that prints a Josephus permutation, receiving two lines of code:
#     • the list itself - numbers separated by a single space representing the people in the circle
#     • a number k
# People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins from the first one
# in the circle and proceeds from left to right. After a specified number of people are skipped,
# the k person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person,
# going in the same direction, and skipping the same number of people until no one remains.
# Print the people by order of executions in the format: "[{executed1},{executed2}, … {executedN}]"
