# On the first line, you will be given the population (numbers separated by comma and space ", ").
# On the second line, you will be given the minimum wealth. You should distribute the wealth so that no part
# of the population has less than the minimum wealth. To do that, you should always take wealth
# from the wealthiest part of the population.
# There will be cases where the distribution will not be possible.
# In that case, print: "No equal distribution possible".
