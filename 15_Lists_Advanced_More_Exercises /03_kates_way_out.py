# On the first line, you will be given how many rows there are in the maze. On the following n lines,
# you will be given the maze itself. Here is a legend for the maze:
#     • "#" - means a wall; Kate cannot go through there
#     • " " - means empty space; Kate can go through there
#     • "k" - the initial position of Kate; start looking for a way out from there
#  are two options: Kate either gets out or not:
#     • If Kate can get out, print the following:
# "Kate got out in {number_of_moves} moves".
# Note: If there are two or more ways out, she always chooses the longest one.
#     • Otherwise, print: "Kate cannot get out".
